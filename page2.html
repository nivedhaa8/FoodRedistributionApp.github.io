        <p style="color: aliceblue;">In a world where millions go to bed hungry every night and where food waste is a staggering global issue, four passionate individuals have come together with a mission - to make a tangible, positive impact on society. We believe in the power of collective action and the potential for change when fueled by compassion and shared values.

            <br>At Food Redistribution, our focus is on building a more equitable and sustainable food ecosystem. We envision a community where no one is left hungry, where excess food doesn't end up in landfills, and where compassion is the driving force behind every meal shared. </p> 
      <h2 style="color: aliceblue;">Our mission</h2>
      <p style="color: aliceblue;">To create a positive impact on the lives of those in need by reducing food waste and building a stronger, more compassionate community.</p>
